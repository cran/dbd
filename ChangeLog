Initial implementation.
This package *REPLACES* the package "hse".  Effectively
this is a namep-change only.  A referee of a paper that
I wrote, based around this package, objected to the name
"hse" ("hope springs eternal") saying that readers might
find this name too frivilous.

Changelogs for the "hse" predecessors of this package may
be found in the CRAN archives.

Version 0.0-1.

29/03/2021

Added the data set "hrsRcePred" and documented it.

Added the function mleBb() and documented it.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-2

30/03/2021

Added the data set "visRecog" and documented it.

Changed the name of the success probability parameter in mleBB() from "p"
to "m" to be consistent with the notation used in rmutil.

Added names to the vector returned by mleBB().

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-3

04/04/2021

Got rid of mleBb(); going with just using the db distribution.

Changed the default value of maxit in mleDb() from 100 to 1000.

Added a maxit argument to simulate.mleDb().

Added maxit arguments to gof().

Modified ddb() to take a "log" argument (defaulting to FALSE).

06/04/2021

Added a "maxit" argument to mcCovMat().

Added the possibility that a warning may be issued (rather
than an error being thrown) in mleDb() or mleBb().  Which
of the two happens is controlled by options()[["maxitErrorOrWarn"]]
which is set to "error" at startup.

Added the function set.eow() to allow the user to switch between
the two options.

Added the function get.eow() to query this option.

07/04/2021

Added functions gradDb() and hessDb() and
revised the grad() and hess() functions from gradHess.R to make use
of them.

Made some adjustments to mleDb() (eliminated an unnecessary
complication) in respect of the way the hessian-cum-covariance
matrix is calculated.

10/04/2021

Fixed a glitche in mleDb() in respect of the names of
the gpar argument used by gfun.  This was mucking everying up
to an incredible extent!

11/04/2021

Added arguments "covmat" and "useGinv" to mleDb().

Amended mcCovMat to call mleDb() with covmat set equal to FALSE.

Corrected sign errors in aHess() and nHess().

Added dimnames attribute to the value returned by nHess().

Added dimnames attribute to the value returned by hessDb().

12/04/2021

Made various other (fairly minor) corrections to the code and to
the help files, fixing errors that were noticed in the course of
fiddling about with them.

13/04/2021

Added a simulate.Vpars() method for simulate.

Added a function makeVpars() to create "Vpars" objects.

Added an example using makeVpars() simulate.Vars() to the help
for ndata.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-4.

23/04/2021

Fixed a stupid glitch w.r.t. setting of seeds in simulate.Dbdpars()
and simulate.mleDb().

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-5.

26/04/2021

Amended mcCovMat() so that it works with objects of class "Dbdpars".

Amended finfo() so that its arguments are the same as (in the same order
as) those of makeDbdpars()

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-6.

Uploaded to CRAN.

30/04/2021

Made changes/corrections at the behest of CRAN (explicitly Gregor Seyer).

* wrapped all examples which use data from hmm.discnp in
    if(requireNamespace("hmm.discnp")) { ... }

* changed instances of "if(require(...))" to "if(requireNamespace("..."))".

* adjusted the value returned by logLik.mleDb() to have class
  "logLik" and an attribute "df" (equal to 2).  Made a corresponding
  adjustment to the help file for logLik.mldDb().

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-7.

Made a correction (re-set par() values if these are changed in
examples!) which I had neglected to make.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-8.
